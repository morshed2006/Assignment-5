Ans : I can create and insert a new element using document.createElement() and appendChild()


3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?
Ans : Event bubbling is when an event starts from the target element and propagates upward through its parent elements.

Ans : Event delegation is attaching a single event listener to a parent element to handle events on its child elements, making code efficient and scalable.
